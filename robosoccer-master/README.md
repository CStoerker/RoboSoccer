# Robot Soccer Simulation Client


## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an agent capable of playing RoboCup 2D Soccer. The project is part of the CS420 Artificial Intelligence Course taught at Lafayette College during the Fall 2015 Semester. The project will be completed by the end of the semester by a small three man team. At the end of the semester a class wide competition will be held to compare the effectiveness of the various teams and strategies.


## Project Schedule
Below is a tentative work schedule for the project broken down by week. Each week will have a tangible deliverable to be completed collectively by the team, and reviewed with the course instructor.

### Week 3:
Choose a framework to handle RoboCup UDP connections. At the end of the week, a basic client framework capable of playing soccer with uninformed agents will be delivered. **DELIVERED**  

### Week 4:
NO ASSIGNMENT...

### Week 5:
#### Overview
The goal this week will be to create three new types of players, each with its own specialized function within the RoboCup Match.

#### Ian's Task:
